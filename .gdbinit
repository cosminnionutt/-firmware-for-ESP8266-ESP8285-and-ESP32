# This is very much a work in progress to show how we can use macros to make the
# GDB interface a lot more useable.  For example the next / step commands only
# work if the stepper doesn't leave the current scope.  Beyond that you have a
# single hardware breakpoint which can be used as an hb or a wa.  You have to
# remember to delete the previous one, so the br macro does this for you.
